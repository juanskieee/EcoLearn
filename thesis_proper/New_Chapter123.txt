INTRODUCTION
Effective solid waste management remains one of the most critical
environmental challenges in the Philippines, exacerbated by rapid urbanization and
population growth. According to the National Solid Waste Management Commission
(NSWMC), the country generates approximately 40,000 tons of waste daily, a figure
projected to rise significantly by 2030 (DENR, 2021). To address this, Republic Act No.
9003, also known as the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, mandates
compulsory segregation at the source.
While this national mandate exists, successful implementation relies on strict
local enforcement and education. The Municipality of Carmona, Cavite, serves as a
prime model for environmental compliance, having been inducted into the DENR
Environmental Management Bureau’s Hall of Fame for its consistent implementation
of solid waste programs (DENR-EMB, 2019). The local government adheres to a strict
"No Segregation, No Collection" policy under Municipal Ordinance No. 007-06.
Specifically, Section 66 of the ordinance establishes a rigorous classification system,
mandating strict segregation into four distinct categories: compostable, recyclable,
2
non-recyclable, and special waste. This study adopts this specific legal framework as
the standardized compliance benchmark for developing educational tools, ensuring
that the instructional content aligns with the highest levels of municipal waste
governance.
Research in developmental psychology suggests that the concepts of
environmental responsibility are most effectively introduced during early childhood,
specifically between the ages of 3 and 6. This period is critical for cognitive
development, where children are most receptive to visual cues and habit formation
(Otto & Pensini, 2017). However, traditional educational methods in preschools, such
as static posters and passive lectures, often fail to capture the attention of digital-native
students. Furthermore, Section 145 of Carmona's Municipal Ordinance explicitly
mandates the implementation of an active Information, Education, and Communication
(IEC) Program. Crucially, this drive for environmental discipline is not merely a local
municipal policy but is reinforced nationally by the Department of Education’s
MATATAG Kindergarten Curriculum. Under the learning area "Makabansa," waste
segregation is formally imposed within the curricular themes "Exploring Our
Community" and "Caring for Our World," which mandate that 5-year-old learners must
demonstrate "proper ways of caring for and protecting one's community" and "show
ways of caring for and protecting our environment" (DepEd, 2024). This creates a clear
necessity for technological interventions that can translate both these abstract legal
mandates and national curriculum standards into concrete, age-appropriate
instructional experiences.
To bridge this gap, this study proposes "EcoLearn," an interactive waste
segregation instructional tool designed for preschoolers. Unlike industrial waste
management systems that rely on heavy computational resources like Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) to detect physical trash, EcoLearn utilizes a Hybrid ORB-KNN
algorithm optimized for educational deployment. This approach allows for lightweight,
explainable, and real-time recognition of Standardized Printable Eco-Cards. By
3
processing these symbolic representations of waste rather than unsanitary 3D objects,
the system establishes a hygienic and controlled learning environment where students
can safely practice and master the logic of segregation.
By integrating computer vision with interactive instructional design, the system
aims to transform the complex task of waste classification into an engaging digital
learning experience. The tool features real-time accuracy tracking and audio-visual
reinforcement to provide immediate feedback, ensuring that students correctly
associate waste items with their corresponding disposal categories. This study moves
beyond simple waste detection; it seeks to facilitate cognitive mastery of environmental
discipline in the next generation, using the rigorous standards of Carmona’s ordinance
as a model for sustainable early childhood education.
Objective of the Study
The main objective of the study is to design, develop, and evaluate "EcoLearn,"
an interactive waste segregation instructional and assessment tool for preschoolers.
The system utilizes the Hybrid ORB-KNN algorithm to facilitate cognitive mastery of
waste classification through digital interaction guided by the system’s official mascot,
"Bin-Bin”.
Specifically, it aims to:
1. design ECOLEARN: An Interactive Waste Segregation Teaching Tool
that:
a. captures images of standardized, printable waste flashcards
(Eco-Cards) placed by students on a designated scanning mat
through an external overhead web camera;
b. extracts unique image features using the ORB algorithm and
categorizes them into four (4) distinct streams: compostable,
recyclable, non-recyclable, and special waste;
c. provides immediate audio-visual instructional feedback
featuring the "Bin-Bin" mascot, who delivers positive
4
reinforcement or corrective guidance based on the classification
result;
d. features a "Knowledge Assessment Mode" where students scan
cards independently to evaluate their retention and mastery of
waste classification without real-time corrective feedback; and
e. Displays a "Comparative Performance Dashboard" that ranks
student proficiency based on assessment scores using
pseudonyms (nicknames) to track class progress.
2. develop the system using the following:
a. Python, OpenCV, and Flask for the core computer vision
microservice, which maintains a persistent state to enable realtime ORB-KNN classification;
b. PHP for server-side scripting, acting as the client that sends
asynchronous API requests to the Python engine and logs
assessment data to the backend database;
c. MySQL for storing the "Universal Golden Dataset," along with
student nicknames, proficiency records, and assessment logs;
d. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for designing the interactive
instructional interface and handling real-time "Bin-Bin" mascot
animations;
e. XAMPP for providing the local web server environment
(Apache) and managing the MySQL database services,
ensuring the system runs offline as a standalone tool;
f. Web Camera for real-time capturing of flashcards to be
processed by the recognition model; and
g. Laptop for hosting and deploying the application as a
standalone educational station.
3. test the system in terms of unit, integration, and system testing;
5
4. evaluate the system using the adopted International Organization for
Standardization 25010 evaluation instrument; and
5. prepare an implementation plan.
Significance of the Study
By utilizing the Hybrid ORB-KNN algorithm, this study aims to modernize
environmental education, facilitate cognitive mastery of waste classification, and
provide a standardized, technology-driven approach to early childhood environmental
instruction.
Preschoolers. As the primary beneficiaries, will become active participants in
environmental protection through an interactive, mascot-guided learning system that
simplifies waste segregation into an engaging multisensory experience, fostering early
ecological awareness and classification skills among children aged 3–6.
Preschool Teachers and School Administrators. They benefit from a
standardized, ready-to-deploy teaching aid that automates feedback and generates
student proficiency records. Since the system is aligned with the MATATAG
Kindergarten Curriculum themes of "Caring for Our World" and "Exploring Our
Community," it serves as a compliant instructional tool that directly supports the
"Makabansa" learning competencies, providing objective performance data to identify
learning gaps and simplify curriculum delivery.
Parents and the Community. Through the concept of "Reverse Socialization,"
children who achieve mastery of segregation at school often transfer this knowledge
to household practices. By ensuring students strictly understand the difference
between waste categories, this study aims to create a ripple effect that improves
household awareness, indirectly supporting the community’s waste reduction goals.
Future Researchers. They often lack practical references for lightweight,
reproducible AI-based waste recognition systems; this study addresses this gap by
presenting an offline Hybrid ORB-KNN model and introducing Standardized Printable
6
Eco-Cards as a replicable, low-cost dataset methodology for educational technologies
in resource-constrained settings.
Carmona City CENRO. They will benefit from EcoLearn’s pilot implementation
at Carmona Elementary School by obtaining site-specific, data-driven insights into
preschoolers’ environmental literacy. Because the system is calibrated to Municipal
Ordinance No. 007-06, the study also functions as a compliance audit on how
effectively mandated waste categories are taught, providing CENRO with a validated
basis for enhancing its IEC campaigns without developing proprietary software.
The Environment. This study contributes to long-term sustainability.
Cultivating a generation of environmentally conscious citizens significantly reduces the
contamination of recyclable materials and lowers the volume of residual waste
destined for landfills.
SDGs. This study supports the UN 2030 Agenda by aligning with SDG 4
through innovative digital learning tools, SDG 11 by promoting data-driven educational
governance, and SDG 12 by fostering early awareness of responsible waste
segregation and environmental stewardship.
Time and Place of the Study
The study will be conducted at Carmona Elementary School in Carmona,
Cavite, which was strategically selected as the pilot site due to its strict implementation
of Municipal Ordinance No. 007-06. Since the EcoLearn system is algorithmically
calibrated to the waste classification categories defined in Section 66 of this ordinance,
the school provides an ideal real-world setting to validate the tool’s instructional
accuracy and legal relevance. Although pilot testing is centralized at this institution for
consistent evaluation, the system features a generic, standalone design that allows
easy deployment along with its Standardized Printable Eco-Cards to other public and
private preschools without site-specific calibration. Development and pilot
implementation are scheduled to begin in January 2026.
7
Scope and Limitation of the Study
Scope of the Study This study focuses on the design, development, and
technical evaluation of "EcoLearn," an interactive waste segregation instructional and
assessment tool designed for preschoolers (aged 3 to 6 years old). The study is strictly
a software-based pilot implementation conducted at Carmona Elementary School in
Carmona, Cavite. The system utilizes the Hybrid ORB-KNN (Oriented FAST and
Rotated BRIEF - K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm to facilitate cognitive mastery of
waste classification through digital instruction and automated knowledge assessment.
System Capabilities and Generic Deployment. The scope is limited to the
development of a standalone software application deployed on a standard consumergrade laptop. Unlike client-based systems that require site-specific calibration, this
system utilizes a "Universal Golden Dataset" pre-trained to recognize a specific set of
Standardized Printable Eco-Cards. The software includes a built-in "Asset Repository"
allowing users to generate high-resolution PDF templates of these cards, ensuring the
system is generic and replicable in any school environment without retraining the
algorithm.
Target Users and Data Privacy. The pilot phase involves two user groups:
preschoolers, who interact with the system using the printed Eco-Cards, and
proponents, who serve as system administrators. To adhere to strict data privacy
standards, the system employs a "Nickname-Based Identification System." No
personally identifiable information (PII) is collected; instead, students select
pseudonyms to track their progress on the "Comparative Performance Dashboard,"
which ranks proficiency based on assessment scores.
Data Classification and Ordinance Compliance. The system strictly adheres
to the classification standards of Municipal Ordinance No. 007-06, categorizing waste
into four (4) distinct streams: Compostable, Recyclable, Non-Recyclable, and Special
Waste. The recognition capability is powered by ORB feature extraction and KNN
classification, processing images of the standardized 2D Eco-Cards.
8
Technical Architecture. The development stack includes Python and OpenCV
for the core computer vision logic (ORB-KNN), PHP for server-side bridging, MySQL
for storing assessment logs and student proficiency records, and
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the interactive front-end featuring the "Bin-Bin" mascot. The
system runs on a local XAMPP environment, ensuring full offline functionality.
Limitations of the Study Dependency on Print Quality. A critical limitation of
this study is the system’s dependency on the visual fidelity of the physical input. The
recognition accuracy of the ORB-KNN algorithm is directly correlated with the print
quality of the Eco-Cards. Factors such as low resolution (below 300 DPI), poor ink
saturation, grayscale printing of colored assets, or use of non-standard paper textures
may significantly degrade feature extraction and reduce system responsiveness. The
study assumes the use of high-quality, full-color prints on matte or semi-gloss
cardstock for optimal performance.
No Physical Waste Handling. The study is strictly limited to the use of 2D EcoCards for all instructional and assessment phases. The detection of actual, physical
3D waste objects is excluded from the scope to ensure hygiene and safety for
preschool participants. The system serves as a cognitive instructional tool, not a
physical waste-sorting machine. While the system utilizes 2D cards for reliability, the
instructional goal is Symbolic Mastery associating the visual label (e.g., an image of a
sachet) with the correct disposal category (Red Bin) which effectively transfers to
physical waste handling behavior through reverse socialization.
Assessment vs. Behavioral Tracking. The system evaluates postinstructional cognitive proficiency students’ ability to identify and categorize waste
cards after guided instruction rather than pre-existing knowledge or real-world
behavioral compliance. It assesses knowledge retention only and functions as a
cognitive instructional tool, not a physical waste-sorting system.
Lighting Conditions. The computer vision engine is calibrated for "Standard
Classroom Lighting Environments" (approximately 300-500 lux). Extreme lighting
9
conditions, such as dim rooms or direct sunlight glare on the glossy card surface, are
excluded from the scope, as these variances affect the contrast required for the ORB
algorithm to detect key points.
Definition of Terms
Technical Terms
Confusion Matrix. A specific table layout that allows visualization of the
performance of an algorithm by comparing the Actual Class against the Predicted
Class to identify specific error patterns (Stehman, 1997). In this study, it is used to
quantify which Standardized Eco-Cards are most frequently misclassified by the
system.
Hybrid ORB-KNN Algorithm. A computer vision architecture that combines
ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), a fast binary descriptor invariant to rotation
and noise (Rublee et al., 2011), with KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), a non-parametric
classifier used for pattern matching (Zhang et al., 2019). In this study, this lightweight
model replaces heavy Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enable real-time
image recognition on standard consumer-grade laptops without internet access.
Microservice Architecture. An architectural style where an application is
structured as a collection of loosely coupled services (Newman, 2015). EcoLearn
adopts this by separating the User Interface (PHP/HTML) from the Computer Vision
Engine (Python), communicating via internal HTTP requests to optimize resource
management.
One-Shot Learning. A computer vision capability that allows a system to learn
information about object categories from one, or only a few, training images (Zhang et
al., 2019). In EcoLearn, this allows the Administrator to register a new Standardized
Eco-Card into the database instantly by scanning it once, without the need for
extensive retraining or thousands of image samples.
Region of Interest (ROI). A specific subset of samples within a dataset
identified for a particular purpose (Karami et al., 2017). In this study, it refers to the
10
"Green Box" overlay on the live webcam feed where the student must position the
Standardized Eco-Card for optimal detection.
Operational Terms
Admin Dashboard. The secure, password-protected backend interface
designed for the proponents. It provides tools to manage the Universal Golden
Dataset, generate Standardized Eco-Cards via the Asset Repository, and view systemgenerated Proficiency Analytics.
Assessment Mode. A distinct operational state of the software where the "BinBin" instructional feedback is disabled. This mode is used to verify the system's ability
to log raw classification data without user assistance, serving as a functional contrast
to the Instructional Mode.
Asset Repository. A built-in system module that stores the high-resolution
digital templates of the Eco-Cards. It functions as a "Print Engine," allowing the
Administrator to download and print consistent, standardized 4×5-inch PDF cards to
ensure the physical input matches the digital training data.
Classification Accuracy. The primary performance metric logged by the
system, defined as the percentage of correctly identified Eco-Cards during a session.
This data point is calculated by the PHP backend (Correct Scans / Total Scans) to
quantify system reliability and user proficiency.
Instructional Feedback ("Bin-Bin"). The primary output mechanism of the
system. It features an animated mascot ("Bin-Bin") that provides immediate audiovisual guidance, delivering positive reinforcement (e.g., "Correct!") or corrective advice
based on the classification result of the scanned card.
Instructional Mode. The default operational state of the system where the
"Bin-Bin" mascot is active. In this mode, the system provides real-time validation and
audio-visual cues to guide the user in correctly identifying the waste category of the
scanned Eco-Card.
11
Proficiency Analytics. Quantitative system logs stored in the MySQL
database track key metrics classification accuracy and response latency to verify data
storage and system reliability.
Standardized Printable Eco-Cards. The specific physical inputs used by the
system. These are 4×5-inch cards printed from the Asset Repository, containing highfidelity reference images. They replace "real trash" to ensure hygienic, consistent, and
reliable detection by the ORB-KNN algorithm.
Two-Phase Learning Protocol. The operational workflow designed to validate
the system's dual functionality, consisting of: (1) Instructional Mode—where the system
provides automated feedback, and (2) Assessment Mode—where the system logs
performance data without providing feedback.
Universal Golden Dataset. The master collection of reference feature vectors
stored in the system. Unlike a site-specific dataset, this is a pre-calibrated library linked
1:1 with the Standardized Eco-Cards, allowing the system to be deployed in any
location without initial training.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
This chapter presents related literature and studies that provide the theoretical
and empirical foundation for the development of "EcoLearn," an interactive waste
segregation instructional and assessment tool for preschoolers. The review is
organized into five thematic sections: Early Childhood as the Critical Period for
Environmental Cognition, Interactive Instructional Design and Digital Feedback
Mechanisms, Standardization of Educational Assets amidst Heterogeneous Waste,
The Legal Framework as a Compliance Benchmark, and Computer Vision
Architectures for Offline Education (ORB-KNN vs. CNN).
Early Childhood as the Critical Period for Environmental Cognition
The success of environmental education relies heavily on the timing of its
introduction. Research in developmental psychology suggests that the "formative
years," specifically between ages 3 and 7, are the most critical period for establishing
lifelong ecological concepts. Otto and Pensini (2017) conducted a longitudinal study
demonstrating that environmental behaviors learned during early childhood are more
resistant to change than those learned in adulthood. Their findings suggest that naturebased education in preschool leads to "pro-environmentalism" that persists into
adolescence.
However, the challenge lies in the abstraction of the concept. Torquati et al.
(2020) argue that waste segregation is often too abstract for young minds to grasp
without concrete visualization. Jean Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development
supports this, positing that children in the "Pre-Operational Stage" (ages 2–7) learn
best through symbolic play and immediate visual interaction rather than passive
listening (McLeod, 2018). This cognitive gap necessitates the use of tools that
transform the abstract concept of "segregation" into a concrete, interactive activity.
Furthermore, Spiteri (2020) emphasizes that "Action Competence" in young
children, the ability to take action on environmental issues, must be built through
13
repetitive, guided practice rather than one-off lectures. Tungpalan (2020) corroborates
this in the Philippine context, finding that local preschool curriculums often lack
interactive materials, relying instead on static visual aids that fail to engage "digitalnative" learners. This "instructional void" validates the need for EcoLearn, which
translates abstract legal mandates into concrete, interactive assessments suitable for
the pre-operational cognitive stage of Filipino children.
Interactive Instructional Design and Digital Feedback Mechanisms
To bridge the gap between abstract concepts and child engagement, modern
educators increasingly turn to Interactive Instructional Design. Unlike traditional
behavioral conditioning which relies on physical rewards, this approach focuses on
Cognitive Scaffolding through immediate digital feedback.
The underlying principle aligns with Constructivist Learning Theory, where
learners actively construct knowledge through interaction. In the context of "EcoLearn,"
this manifests through the "Bin-Bin" Digital Instructor. Homer et al. (2018) found that
digital indicators of competence (such as on-screen progress tracking) significantly
increase immediate task engagement in children by providing a sense of mastery.
Linehan and Kirman (2019) argue that interactive software functions as a
"behavioral architecture," where the system acts as the scaffolding agent, reducing the
burden on teachers to provide constant individual correction. Crucially, Dichev and
Dicheva (2017) warn that instructional tools must be "meaningful," meaning the
interaction mechanics (sorting cards) must directly mimic the real-world skill.
The integration of interactive elements in Philippine basic education has proven
effective. A 2025 study by Namoco et al. on public elementary learners in Butuan City
demonstrated that interactive strategies (real-time feedback and progress tracking)
significantly improved academic performance and engagement compared to traditional
worksheets. Similarly, Rakasiwi et al. (2025) found that digital learning tools in local
schools successfully bridged the gap between "knowing" and "doing," transforming
passive awareness into active cognitive mastery. EcoLearn adopts these proven
14
strategies by utilizing Continuous Accuracy Tracking (The Comparative Dashboard) to
sustain attention in resource-constrained classrooms.
Digital Assessment as a Measure of Cognitive Mastery
Beyond instruction, digital tools serve as effective mechanisms for formative
assessment in early childhood. Unlike traditional paper-and-pencil tests which require
literacy skills that preschoolers lack, image-based digital assessments allow students
to demonstrate post-instructional understanding through direct interaction. The
system's Knowledge Assessment Mode functions as a formative assessment tool that
measures retention after guided learning, rather than testing innate or pre-existing
knowledge. Namoco et al. (2025) observed that automated systems provide "unbiased
accuracy metrics," eliminating teacher subjectivity.
Standardization of Educational Assets vs. Heterogeneous Waste Streams
Designing an accurate recognition system requires addressing the complexity
of the local waste stream. While global datasets exist, they often fail to account for the
unique composition of waste in Philippine educational institutions. Recent studies by
Flores and Lacang (2024) and Barcelo et al. (2024) characterize the waste profile in
Philippine schools as highly specific, dominated by three major fractions: recyclables
(specifically paper and PET bottles) accounting for 42.08%, residuals (specifically
single-use flexible plastics and sachets) at 30%, and biodegradable food waste at
20.8%. Flores and Lacang (2024) further highlight that hazardous 'Special Waste'
comprises less than 1% of school-generated trash.
This data necessitates a shift from generic, large-scale datasets to a targeted
'Standardized Dataset' approach. Instead of training the algorithm on thousands of
irrelevant items, this study focuses on the top 10 most frequent waste items per
category identified in these local studies. This ensures that the 'EcoLearn' system is
optimized to recognize the actual 'Sachet Economy' waste preschoolers encounter
daily such as 3-in-1 coffee packets and plastic labo which are frequently misclassified
in generic Western datasets (Barcelo et al., 2024).
15
EcoLearn facilitates this by strictly adhering to the waste taxonomy mandated
by Republic Act No. 9003 (Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000) and
validated in recent school-based assessments by Flores and Lacang (2024):
Compostable, Recyclable, Residual, and Special Waste.
The Legal Framework as a Compliance Benchmark
While the system is generic, its instructional logic is grounded in the strict
compliance standards of Carmona, Cavite, a recognized DENR Hall of Fame Awardee.
The study uses the municipality’s ordinance as a Standard of Excellence for
calibration.
Republic Act No. 9003 mandates segregation at the source , and Section 55
explicitly requires its integration into academic curricula. Locally, the study’s
classification engine is anchored on Municipal Ordinance No. 007-06:
• Section 66 (Mandatory Segregation) mandates the separation of waste into the
four specific streams used in the app.
• Section 145 (IEC Campaign) requires active education programs.
Atienza (2019) notes that implementation often fails due to "weak behavioral
enforcement". Antonio (2020) suggests that since Local Government Units (LGUs) lack
manpower for monitoring, "educational automation" serves as a viable alternative for
widespread training. By aligning the generic tool with these strict local laws, EcoLearn
ensures that any preschooler using the system is trained to meet the highest regulatory
standards.
The National Curriculum: Alignment with MATATAG Kindergarten Framework
While local ordinances provide the legal penalty for non-compliance, the Department
of Education’s MATATAG Kindergarten Curriculum provides the pedagogical mandate
for waste segregation. The curriculum explicitly integrates environmental stewardship
under the macro-themes "Exploring Our Community" and "Caring for Our World" within
the "Makabansa" learning area (DepEd, 2024). Specifically, Learning Competency 22
requires learners to "demonstrate proper ways of caring and protecting one's
16
community" , while Competency 40 mandates them to "show ways of caring for and
protecting our environment" and Competency 43 requires them to "classify objects
based on observable properties".
This national framework validates EcoLearn’s operational logic. By digitizing the
classification process, the system directly addresses the curriculum's requirement for
"observable properties"-based classification. As noted by Tungpalan (2020), early
childhood education often lacks interactive tools to teach these specific competencies.
EcoLearn fills this gap by providing a digital platform that ensures students meet both
the legal standards of Carmona’s Ordinance No. 007-06 and the academic standards
of the MATATAG Curriculum.
Computer Vision: Suitability of ORB-KNN for Standardized Inputs
In the field of computer vision, a significant divergence exists between "Deep
Learning" (CNNs) and "Feature-Based" (ORB/SIFT) approaches for object detection.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as ResNet, VGG-16, or YOLO, are
currently regarded as the gold standard for recognizing objects in complex,
unstructured, and highly variable environments (Dhillon & Verma, 2020). However,
their deployment in educational settings is often hindered by high computational costs.
While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer high accuracy, they require
substantial computational resources that exceed the capabilities of standard
educational laptops (Rublee et al., 2011; Mekki et al., 2024). Mekki et al. (2024)
emphasize that deploying deep learning models on embedded systems often results
in unacceptable latency without specialized hardware accelerators.
In contrast, the Hybrid ORB-KNN architecture is optimized for standardized 2D
flashcard inputs. ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), introduced by Rublee et
al. (2011), is a fast binary descriptor that is invariant to rotation and scale. This
geometric invariance is essential for preschool users who may present Eco-Cards at
irregular angles. ORB is invariant to rotation and scale, a critical feature validated in
recent comparative studies on edge devices (Taha & Hameed, 2024), ensuring reliable
17
detection despite the developing motor skills of children.. Karami et al. (2017) further
showed that ORB is two orders of magnitude faster than SIFT and significantly lighter
than CNNs, sustaining high frame rates on standard CPUs without internet access.
Real-time responsiveness is achieved through efficient binary descriptor
matching. Unlike SIFT or SURF, which rely on complex floating-point computations,
ORB uses binary strings matched via the Hamming distance, a simple bitwise
operation. This computational efficiency enables the “Bin-Bin” mascot to deliver
immediate audio-visual feedback in under one second, a key requirement for
sustaining preschoolers’ attention (Rublee et al., 2011).
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier complements ORB by enabling
zero-latency adaptation. Unlike CNN-based systems that require time-consuming
retraining when new waste categories or card designs are introduced, feature-based
matching supports one-shot learning (Zhang et al., 2019). This allows EcoLearn to
recognize new Printable Eco-Cards by simply storing their keypoints, supporting the
study’s goal of a scalable and easily updatable assessment tool. Consequently, while
CNNs excel in recognizing complex 3D waste, the Hybrid ORB-KNN approach is better
suited for controlled environments.
Review of Related Systems and Applications
To establish the state of the art in waste management technology, ten existing
systems were reviewed, prioritizing those that utilize gamification strategies for
children and digital segregation tools. In early childhood education, several
applications employ intuitive mechanics to teach waste segregation standards. Basura
Buster (Department of Environment and Natural Resources [DENR], 2021) is a notable
local example designed for children aged 5 to 8, using a drag-and-drop interface to
sort trash according to Philippine standards. Similarly, Grow Recycling (Gro Play,
2025) and Garbage Gobblers (Bored Monkey, 2018) use character-driven interactions
and visual feedback to engage preschool-aged users and reinforce environmental
awareness.
18
Beyond basic sorting mechanics, various platforms have adopted arcade-style
and simulation elements to reinforce knowledge retention. Recycle Roundup (National
Geographic Kids, 2019) serves as a web-based instructional tool that provides
immediate factual feedback on specific waste items. To test user reflexes and rapid
decision-making, Eco Sort 2026 (OG Interactives, 2026) challenges players to switch
modes between biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories dynamically.
Furthermore, EcoSort (Binus Game Development Club, 2020) expands the scope of
gameplay by introducing logistical elements, requiring users to not only segregate
hazardous and organic waste but also manage its shipment to recycling centers,
highlighting the broader waste management cycle.
In terms of behavioral modification and utility, applications have been
developed to support sustainable lifestyles and information retrieval. JouleBug (2019)
gamifies daily eco-friendly habits by awarding badges and fostering social competition,
demonstrating how digital achievements can motivate real-world waste reduction.
Complementing this is iRecycle (2019), which functions as a location-based utility for
identifying disposal options for over 350 materials. While less gamified, it provides the
critical informational infrastructure necessary for users to practice the disposal
methods advocated by educational games, aligning with the instructional objectives of
the proposed study.
Finally, recent technological advancements have integrated artificial
intelligence and computer vision to automate waste recognition, directly paralleling the
technical architecture of the proposed thesis. Litterati (2018) utilizes geo-tagging and
image recognition to crowdsource litter mapping, demonstrating the efficacy of visual
analysis in identifying waste on a global scale. On a household level, the prototype
application Pilahin (Putra & Harjoko, 2025) employs similar image recognition features
to assist users in categorizing waste. These systems validate the feasibility of using
visual algorithms, such as the proposed Hybrid ORB-KNN, to enhance the accuracy
and interactivity of waste segregation tools.
19
Synthesis of Related Studies
The reviewed literature establishes that early childhood (ages 3–7) is a critical
period for forming lifelong environmental habits. Studies by Otto and Pensini (2017)
and Spiteri (2020) indicate that although this stage is optimal for habit formation, waste
segregation concepts require concrete and visual interventions to be effective. The
literature also identifies an instructional gap: traditional methods such as posters and
lectures fail to engage digital-native preschoolers, while many existing mobile
applications remain purely screen-based and lack the tactile learning experiences
essential for the pre-operational stage.
Furthermore, a clear divergence exists in technological approaches to waste
management. Advanced systems often rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
for high-accuracy detection (e.g., Litterati; Mekki et al., 2024), but these methods are
computationally expensive and unsuitable for resource-constrained public schools in
the Philippines. In contrast, lightweight algorithms such as ORB-KNN have proven
effective for feature-based recognition (Rublee et al., 2011; Taha & Hameed, 2024) yet
remain underutilized in educational gamification for waste sorting.The synthesis also
reveals a contextual gap in existing datasets, as most global studies rely on Western
waste profiles that do not reflect the Philippine “Sachet Economy” (Flores & Lacang,
2024). This mismatch limits the effectiveness of generic AI tools in local classrooms
where sachets and small residual wastes are prevalent..
EcoLearn bridges these gaps by integrating three key domains: (1)
pedagogical strategy, shifting from passive instruction to active, manipulative-based
learning through physical Eco-Cards; (2) technological optimization, favoring the
lightweight Hybrid ORB-KNN algorithm over CNNs to ensure offline usability on
standard school laptops; and (3) regulatory compliance, aligning waste classification
with Municipal Ordinance No. 007-06 and the MATATAG Kindergarten Curriculum.
Unlike existing mobile games that operate solely in virtual environments, the system
combines physical interaction with digital feedback, resulting in a standardized tool.

METHODOLOGY
Material
EcoLearn will be developed using Visual Studio Code, with HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript for a preschool-friendly interface (ages 3–6) featuring high-contrast visuals
and large interactive elements. Its core logic uses Python with OpenCV and Flask to
run a Computer Vision Microservice performing real-time Hybrid ORB-KNN recognition
of Standardized 2D Eco-Cards, while PHP manages server-side operations,
asynchronous communication, and PDF generation of printable cards. MySQL stores
the Universal Golden Dataset, Student Proficiency Records (anonymous nicknames),
and assessment logs. The system runs fully offline via XAMPP on a consumer-grade
laptop with Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM along with a 720p USB webcam mounted 30–
40 cm above a scanning mat, and Mermaid Live generates architecture and data flow
diagrams.
Methods
The Evolutionary Prototyping Development model (Fig. 1) of Pressman and
Maxim (2020) was used as the development lifecycle.
Figure 1. Evolutionary Prototyping Model (Pressman & Maxim, 2020)
21
The Evolutionary Prototyping Model (Figure 1) is a cyclical software
development approach ideal for educational assessment tools needing continuous
refinement based on user interaction and instructional accuracy. It was chosen for
EcoLearn to iteratively fine-tune the ORB-KNN algorithm for Standardized Printable
Eco-Cards and adjust feedback mechanisms according to preschooler responses. The
model’s workflow uses forward arrows to show progression from Requirements
Gathering through Quick Design, Prototype Building, User Evaluation, and Final
Product, while a feedback arrow labeled “No” returns from User Acceptance to
Prototype, enabling repeated refinements. This iterative cycle ensures the Assessment
Module accurately logs student proficiency, which serves as the ultimate measure of
system success.
Requirements Gathering. Prior to development, the proponents will conduct
a comprehensive Content and Compliance Analysis to establish the generic system's
functional baselines. Instead of site-specific assessments, this phase focuses on
strictly aligning the classification logic with Municipal Ordinance No. 007-06 to ensure
the "Universal Golden Dataset" is legally compliant. Simultaneously, the proponents
will define the appropriate pedagogical requirements for preschoolers (ages 3–6) to
guide the design of the "Bin-Bin" mascot and Standardized Eco-Cards, while also
establishing technical constraints to ensure the Hybrid ORB-KNN algorithm remains
lightweight for offline deployment on standard public-school laptops.
Quick Design. This stage focuses on the development of a Standardized
Universal System through the establishment of a pre-calibrated recognition model. The
proponents will curate a 'Universal Golden Dataset' composed of 46 Standardized
Printable Eco-Cards (10 per category). The selection of these 46 items was strictly
data-driven, based on the dominant waste fractions in Philippine schools identified by
Flores and Lacang (2024). This reduction from a massive theoretical dataset to a
targeted standardized set serves two critical functions:
22
1. Cognitive Appropriateness: It respects the cognitive load limits of children aged
3-6 (Jean Piaget’s Pre-Operational Stage) by focusing on mastery of core items
rather than overwhelming memorization.
2. Performance Efficiency: It ensures the system maintains sub-second response
times on standard school laptops by processing a lean, high-quality feature
set."
This dataset is paired 1:1 with a set of Standardized Printable Eco-Cards
generated as high-resolution PDF assets (300 DPI); by controlling the visual input
through these standardized cards, the system guarantees that feature extraction
remains consistent and replicable across any school environment without the need for
local retraining.
Simultaneously, the operational workflow is designed as an "Instructional-toAssessment Pipeline" where students first engage in Guided Learning Mode (with "BinBin" feedback), followed by an Independent Assessment Phase that logs proficiency
metrics (accuracy and speed) to measure knowledge retention. To ensure hygiene and
hardware security, the physical deployment strictly utilizes the printed cards within a
designated "Green Box" scanning zone, keeping the laptop out of reach of the
preschoolers and eliminating the health risks associated with handling actual waste
materials.
23
This phase involved the creation of the Operational Framework using the InputProcess-Output (IPO) model to illustrate the system's data flow and transformation
logic. This conceptual design is illustrated in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Input-Process-Output (IPO) Model of EcoLearn
As shown in Figure 2, EcoLearn follows a three-phase workflow: Input,
Process, and Output. The Input Phase combines the Universal Golden Dataset with
live webcam captures of Standardized Printable Eco-Cards and accepts Student
Nicknames to start the session, sending raw frames to the server via AJAX to maintain
a thin-client setup. In the Process Phase, the Python Flask Microservice handles image
pre-processing (grayscale), ORB feature extraction, and KNN classification, while the
PHP backend calculates real-time proficiency metrics such as accuracy and
recognition speed. The Output Phase delivers immediate instructional feedback to
students via the Bin-Bin mascot and simultaneously generates Student Proficiency
Records and downloadable compliance reports for administrators.
24
The design specifications for the key modules were finalized at this stage, and
a System Architecture Diagram was developed to illustrate the interaction between the
frontend interface, the backend logic, and the computer vision engine, as shown in
Figure 3
Figure 3. System Architecture Diagram of EcoLearn
As illustrated in Figure 3, the system adopts a Five-Tiered Hybrid Architecture
optimized for offline efficiency and modular separation of concerns. The External Input
tier begins with the Standardized Eco-Card, providing consistent visual input. The
25
Client Layer acts as a thin client, featuring the Webcam Capture Module, Preschool
Interface for Bin-Bin feedback, and Admin Dashboard. It performs no heavy
processing, capturing the ROI and sending Base64 images via AJAX.
The Application Layer hosts the PHP Controller and persistent Python Flask
API, which processes HTTP POST requests without reloading the interpreter. The
Machine Learning Layer runs the ORB-KNN Recognition Engine in a warm state,
holding feature templates in memory for rapid extraction and matching. The Data Layer
stores the Universal Golden Dataset for reference and the Student Records DB for
proficiency logs and analytics. This separation decouples heavy computation from the
interface, enabling real-time feedback for preschoolers while logging detailed data for
administrators.
To visualize the user interactions and functional permissions required to
support the system’s operation, the Use Case Diagram is detailed in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Use Case Diagram of EcoLearn
26
As illustrated in Figure 4, the system supports two primary actors: the
Preschooler and the Administrator. The Preschooler follows a simple, login-free
workflow were scanning a Standardized Eco-Card automatically triggers immediate
audio-visual instructional feedback. In contrast, the Administrator handles backend
management and data integrity; after authentication, they can manage the Universal
Golden Dataset, view proficiency analytics, and access the asset repository for printing
Eco-Cards, with all administrative actions requiring prior login.
To visualize the data structure required to support these functions, the EntityRelationship Diagram (ERD) is detailed in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Entity Relationship Diagram of EcoLearn
27
Figure 5 illustrates the EcoLearn Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD),
presenting a normalized database schema for secure and reliable data management.
The schema is centered on TBL_ADMIN, which stores encrypted administrator
credentials and controls system settings, assets, and student sessions. Waste
classification is defined in TBL_CATEGORIES, linked to TBL_CARD_ASSETS and
TBL_GOLDEN_DATASET, where the binary ORB feature vectors for recognition are
stored. Student performance tracking is handled through TBL_SESSIONS for session
metadata and TBL_SCAN_TRANSACTIONS for individual scan records, including
card IDs, accuracy, and response time, while system adaptability is maintained via
TBL_SYSTEM_CONFIG, allowing dynamic adjustment of ORB sensitivity thresholds
and model versions without source code changes.
Build Prototype. This phase focused on full-stack development of the
EcoLearn system using a Hybrid Local Architecture to ensure offline stability and highfidelity performance. Development was organized into three core modules: the Student
Interface, built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, providing a distraction-free
environment with an ROI overlay and the animated "Bin-Bin" mascot for immediate,
randomized audio-visual feedback during Instructional Mode, with the ability to toggle
to Knowledge Assessment Mode where feedback is withheld to measure independent
mastery; the Computer Vision Engine, implemented as a persistent Python Flask
microservice that loads OpenCV and the Universal Golden Dataset at startup to enable
millisecond-level ORB-KNN inference without per-request reloading; and the
Administrator Dashboard, a secure control panel offering an asset repository for PDF
Eco-Card generation, a one-shot learning module for instant card registration, and
proficiency analytics with PDF compliance report export. The entire system operates
on a local XAMPP server (Apache and MySQL), ensuring zero latency and full offline
functionality.
28
Customer Evaluation. This phase will be conducted at Carmona Elementary
School in Carmona, Cavite, to validate the operational compliance of the EcoLearn
System. The protocol is divided into three stages: Phase 1 (Unit & Integration Testing)
verifies the stability of core modules, including the Webcam Capture and One-Shot
Learning integrity; Phase 2 (Technical Quality Assessment) engages IT experts to audit
the system against ISO 25010 standards, specifically measuring Performance
Efficiency (response latency), Reliability (ORB-KNN accuracy), and Usability (interface
intuitiveness) via a 5-point Likert scale. Phase 3 (System Validation) deploys the
software in a live classroom environment to validate the Two-Phase Instructional
Workflow: first, students engage with the Instructional Mode where "Bin-Bin" provides
real-time corrective feedback; second, students transition to Knowledge Assessment
Mode where they independently scan cards without assistance. This stress-test
validates the system's ability to log post-instructional proficiency data and measure
learning outcomes following guided instruction. Data analysis will utilize Confusion
Matrices and System Logs to quantify recognition error rates, ensuring the software
meets the required technical specifications for deployment.
Final Product. Final Product. Upon successful completion of deployment
testing and ISO 25010 validation, the final output will be a fully functional, standalone
educational software suite designed for offline deployment on a standard consumergrade laptop paired with an external webcam, serving as a portable "Plug-and-Play"
instructional station without custom hardware. The environment runs on a preconfigured local XAMPP stack (MySQL/PHP) coupled with a Persistent Python ORBKNN Engine for real-time inference, ensuring full functionality without internet
connectivity. The comprehensive educational package includes the EcoLearn
Software Installer (unifying the Admin Dashboard, Student Interface, and Database),
an Asset Repository containing the Universal Golden Dataset and Standardized
Printable Eco-Cards (PDFs), and a full Documentation Suite comprising the source.
29
Technical Implementation of the Hybrid ORB-KNN Algorithm
To ensure the system operates efficiently on standard consumer-grade
hardware without internet dependency, this study implements a Hybrid ORB-KNN
Architecture instead of computationally intensive Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). This specific algorithmic pipeline is designed to process the Standardized
Printable Eco-Cards through a four-stage recognition process:
1. Image Acquisition and Pre-processing. The system captures video frames
at 30 FPS via the webcam. To reduce computational load, the frame is
immediately cropped to the Region of Interest (ROI) the "Green Box" overlay
discarding 80% of the background pixels. The cropped image is then
converted from RGB to Grayscale, eliminating color variance (lighting noise)
while preserving the high-contrast edge features of the Eco-Cards.
2. ORB Feature Extraction (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF). The core
detection engine utilizes ORB, which fuses two distinct techniques:
a. FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test): Detects
"Keypoints" (corners and edges) on the card image.
b. BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features):
Converts these keypoints into binary feature vectors (strings of 0s
and 1s). Crucially, ORB adds an "Orientation" component, making
the recognition Rotation Invariant. This ensures that even if a
preschooler holds the card upside down or sideways, the system
can still match the features correctly.
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification. Once the feature vectors are
extracted, they are passed to the KNN Classifier. The system compares the
live descriptors against the Universal Golden Dataset using the Hamming
Distance metric. Unlike Euclidean distance used in deep learning, Hamming
distance uses bitwise XOR operations, which are extremely fast for the CPU
to calculate.
30
a. The algorithm identifies the K=3 closest matches in the database.
b. A Voting Mechanism determines the final class (e.g., if 3 out of 3
matches are "Plastic Bottle," the system returns "Recyclable").
c. Lowe’s Ratio Test is applied to filter out weak matches (false
positives) caused by background noise.
4. One-Shot Learning Integration. Because the KNN classifier is "lazy" (it
stores data rather than training a model weights file), the system supports
One-Shot Learning. When an Administrator adds a new card via the
dashboard, its features are simply appended to the Golden Dataset. The
system updates instantly without the hours of re-training required by neural
networks.
To visualize this internal processing logic, the algorithm’s structure is detailed
in Figure 6, which presents a step-by-step flow of data from feature extraction through
classification and final decision output.
